On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failed after a bank run, marking the second-largest bank failure in United States history and the largest since the 2008 financial crisis.[1][2] The collapse of SVB has had a significant impact on startups from the U.S. and abroad,[3] with many unable to withdraw money from the bank. Other large technology companies, media companies, and wineries were also impacted.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the tech sector experienced a period of growth. Capitalizing on an increase in deposits in 2021, SVB purchased long-term Treasury bonds. The market value of these bonds decreased through 2022 and into 2023 as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to curb an inflation surge.[4] Higher interest rates also raised borrowing costs throughout the economy and some Silicon Valley Bank clients started pulling money out to meet their liquidity needs. To raise cash to pay withdrawals by its depositors, SVB announced on March 8 that it had sold over US$21 billion worth of securities, borrowed $15 billion, and would hold an emergency sale of some of its treasury stock to raise $2.25 billion, including $500 million from General Atlantic. The announcement, coupled with warnings from prominent Silicon Valley investors, caused a bank run as customers withdrew funds totaling $42 billion by the following day.

On the morning of March 10, 2023, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation seized SVB and placed it under the receivership of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). About 89 percent of the bank's $172 billion in deposit liabilities exceeded the maximum insured by the FDIC.[5][6] Two days after the failure, the FDIC received "exceptional authority" from the Treasury and announced jointly with other agencies that all depositors would have full access to their funds the next morning.[7][8] It reopened the bank as a newly organized bridge bank, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A.,[9] superseding an earlier plan to satisfy depositors through a deposit insurance national bank and receivership dividends.[9][6]

Background
Main article: Silicon Valley Bank
SVB was a commercial bank founded in 1983 and headquartered in Santa Clara, California. At its collapse, SVB was the 16th largest bank in the U.S. and was heavily skewed toward serving companies and individuals from the technology industry.[10][11][12] Nearly half of U.S. venture capital-backed healthcare and technology companies were financed by SVB.[13] Companies such as Airbnb, Cisco, Fitbit, Pinterest, and Block, Inc. have been clients of the bank.[14] In addition to financing venture-backed companies, SVB was well known as a source of private banking, personal credit lines, and mortgages to tech entrepreneurs,[15] and specialized lending money to higher-risk new companies.[16] Silicon Valley Bank required an exclusive relationship of those borrowing from the bank.[17] Prior to March 9, 2023, SVB was in "sound financial condition", according to the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation,[18] though an increased number of short sellers began to target SVB earlier in the year.[19][20] Employees received their annual bonuses on March 10, 2023, hours before the government took control of the company.[21]

As of the last call report of the bank, filed on December 31, 2022, it held $209 billion in total assets, with $175.5 billion in total deposits, of which the bank estimated $151.6 billion (86.4 percent) were uninsured.[22]

Losses
The bank's deposits increased from $62 billion in March 2020 to $124 billion in March 2021, benefiting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on science and technology. Most of these deposits were invested in long-term Treasury bonds as the bank sought a higher return on investment than was available on shorter-term bonds.[23] These long-term bonds fell in current market value as interest rates rose during the 2021–2023 inflation surge and they became less attractive as investments.[24] In April 2022, SVB's chief risk officer stepped down, and a successor was not named until January 2023—a period coinciding with the period of interest rate increases.[25][23] At the end of 2022, its marked-to-market unrealized losses for securities held to maturity exceeded $15 billion.[25][23]

At the same time, startup companies withdrew deposits from the bank to fund their operations as private financing became harder to come by.[26] A series of layoffs in the technology sector that began in 2022 also caused depositors to draw down their savings.[27] To raise needed cash to fund the withdrawals, the bank sold all of its available-for-sale securities, realizing a $1.8 billion loss.[26] The bank was criticized for timing its announcement shortly after Silvergate Bank, which catered to cryptocurrency users, started winding down its operations,[28] and for not lining up private funding ahead of the announcement.[29]

Some banking experts said that the bank would have managed its risks better had it not been for the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, enacted in 2018 and supported by SVB CEO Greg Becker, which reduced the frequency and number of scenarios of required stress testing implemented under the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act for banks with under $250 billion in assets.[30]

Instability
In the week before the collapse, Moody's Investors Service reportedly informed SVB Financial, the bank's holding company, that it was facing a potential double-downgrade of its credit rating because of its unrealized losses.[23] On March 8, 2023, SVB announced it had sold over $21 billion worth of its investments, borrowed $15 billion, and would hold an emergency sale of its stock to raise $2.25 billion.[23] Despite the steps taken by the bank, Moody's downgraded SVB on March 8.[23][31] Investors at several venture capital firms, including executives at Peter Thiel's Founders Fund,[32] urged their portfolio companies to withdraw their deposits from the bank.[33] By the close of business on March 9, customers had withdrawn $42 billion, leaving the bank with a negative cash balance of about $958 million.[34] Among the financial services companies receiving money from SVB customers were Brex, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and First Republic Bank.[35] Venture capital funds including Founders Fund, Union Square Ventures and Coatue Management had encouraged companies in their portfolios to avoid impact from SVB's collapse by withdrawing their money,[36] and Founders Fund withdrew all of its funds from the bank by the morning of March 9.[37] The value of SVB's shares plummeted until a trading halt was implemented on the morning of March 10.[38][39][40][41][42]

On February 27, SVB Financial Group CEO Greg Becker sold 12,451 shares of company stock, worth $3.6 million, through an executive trading plan that he filed with the SEC under Rule 10b5-1 on January 26. The rule has been criticized as a loophole allowing for insider trading. Beginning April 1, the SEC will require a minimum 90-day cooling period for most executive trading plans.[43]

Receivership

The FDIC temporarily created the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara (DINB) to distribute insured deposits until replacing it with a bridge bank.
On the morning of March 10, examiners from the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) arrived at the offices of SVB to assess the company's finances.[44] Several hours later, the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation issued an order taking possession of SVB,[34] citing inadequate liquidity and insolvency,[11] and appointed the FDIC as receiver.[45][46] The FDIC then established the Deposit Insurance National Bank of Santa Clara (DINB) to re-open the bank's branches the following Monday and enable access to insured deposits,[6][47][48][49][50] and it opened an auction over the weekend to find a buyer for the failed bank.[51] The failure of SVB was the largest of any bank since the financial crisis of 2007–2008 and the second-largest failure of an FDIC-insured bank by assets.[52] The size and complexity of SVB's loans influenced the FDIC's initial decision to establish a DINB.[53] The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco stated that the bank's CEO Greg Becker was no longer on its board of directors.[54]

According to regulatory reports as of December 31, 2022, uninsured deposits were estimated to represent 89 percent of total deposits at the bank;[5] however, Moody's Investor Service reported on March 10 that it expected a recovery rate for uninsured depositors of 80–90 percent.[55] The FDIC said it would begin covering uninsured deposits with special dividends within days as SVB's assets were liquidated.[56] The FDIC notified Silicon Valley Bank employees that they would be let go in 45 days' time; in the meantime, it offered salaried employees a 50% raise and hourly employees double pay for any overtime.[57] Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has ruled out bailing out SVB.[58]

In an announcement on March 12, the Treasury, Federal Reserve, and FDIC stated that all depositors would be made whole without expenditure of taxpayer money.[8][59][7] On March 13, 2023, the FDIC transferred SVB assets to a new bridge bank, Silicon Valley Bridge Bank, N.A., and appointed Tim Mayopoulos as CEO.[60][9] The bridge bank consolidated insured and uninsured deposits into a single institution, making it more attractive to prospective buyers.[53]

It is unclear whether the FDIC's guarantee of all deposits at Silicon Valley Bank extends to the $13.9 billion in deposits in the bank's foreign subsidiaries.[61] The Bank of England issued a statement that it sought a court order to place the United Kingdom subsidiary of the bank into a Bank Insolvency Procedure.[62][63] Shanghai Pudong Development Bank issued a statement that its joint operations with SVB, chaired by its own Shanghai-based chairman, were not affected by the collapse as of March 11.[64][65] On March 13, 2023, after a bidding process, it was announced that HSBC UK had agreed to acquire Silicon Valley Bank UK for £1 in a rescue deal, at no cost to taxpayers and with depositors fully protected.[66][67][68] Canadian regulator Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions seized the assets of SVB's Toronto branch on March 12.[69]

An initial auction of Silicon Valley Bank assets on March 12 attracted a single bid. The FDIC rejected this offer and plans to hold a second auction to attract bids from major banks, now that the bank's systemic risk designation allows the FDIC to insure all deposits.[70] On March 13, SVB Financial Group began exploring a potential sale of the bank's sister companies SVB Capital and SVB Securities. The latter's founder, Jeffrey Leerink, has expressed interest in buying back the firm.[71] The bank's loan portfolio, which Moody's recently rated as conservative and high-performing, was not a factor in the collapse and is considered to be an attractive asset. Private equity firms including Apollo Global Management, Blackstone Inc., and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts are considering a purchase of the bank's loans.[72]

On March 13, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors announced an investigation by Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr into supervision and regulation of the bank, which will be released publicly by May 1.[73] The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and U.S. Department of Justice have reportedly opened investigations into the bank's financial disclosures and executives' recent trading plans.[74]

Impact
Experts said that SVB's collapse was unlikely to pose a systemic risk to the U.S. financial system.[75] However, although experts think these effects are temporary, the bank's collapse created hardships among some tech startups, and companies holding significant uninsured deposits and low cash flow faced significant risks.[76][28][77][78]

Customers
Many startups were unable to retrieve money, resulting in companies taking out loans to make payroll.[77][79] Because California state law requires employees to be paid within a certain number of days,[80][81] continued inability to access deposits may cause a large number of startups to furlough workers, reduce their workforce through layoffs, or shut down entirely.[82] The bank's collapse also reduces available funding for startups on the venture debt market, which has grown in importance as venture capital firms have dramatically scaled back their investments.[83] E-commerce company Etsy was forced to delay seller payouts; the company used SVB to send out deposits to some sellers.[84] The bank's collapse coincided with the beginning of the annual, startup-oriented South by Southwest Interactive conference in Austin, Texas. Aside from some disruption caused by SVB credit cards, attendees maintained an air of calm during the event.[85] In the days after the collapse, startup founders and other customers lined up outside bank branches in Silicon Valley and San Francisco, seeking to withdraw their deposits or learn the status of their wire transfers.[86][87]

In a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, streaming media company Roku, Inc. revealed that around a quarter of the company's cash reserves—$487 million—were held by SVB.[88] Other companies affected by the collapse include video game developer Roblox Corporation, video hosting service Vimeo,[89] and payroll processor Rippling.[90][91] Circle, the issuer of USD Coin (USDC), attested that SVB is one of the six banking partners used by the company to manage its cash reserves for USDC.[92] USDC's price fell below its US$1 pegged exchange rate during trading on March 10 and 11, causing Coinbase to halt conversions between USDC and U.S. dollars.[28] USDC had recovered most of the losses after Circle assured investors that the peg would remain honored.[93] More than 1,500 climate change–related technology startups had taken out loans or had lines of credit with Silicon Valley Bank. The failure came at a sensitive time when many such startups were scaling up to meet expected demand from the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.[94]

Outside the technology startup space, Vox Media had its cash concentrated at the bank and saw its SVB-issued credit cards stop working.[77] The California wine industry was also affected by SVB's collapse, since it was a leading regional winery banker.[95] Some Oregon wineries were also affected.[96] The bank's premium wine division had about $1.1 billion in outstanding loans to about 400 clients.[97] Businessman Mark Cuban reportedly had millions in the bank, along with his side venture Cost Plus Drugs.[98][better source needed] Since 2002, the bank had made more than $2 billion in loans and investments, including $1.6 billion in loans since 2014, to build affordable housing in Silicon Valley and San Francisco, as well as Massachusetts (from its 2021 acquisition of Boston Private). Housing advocates predicted delays and difficulty assembling funding.[99]

On March 13, many technology entrepreneurs regained access to their deposits.[16]

Shareholders
Silicon Valley Bank's holding company, SVB Financial Group, was a component of the S&P 500. At the time of the collapse, its largest shareholders included The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, and State Street Corporation, which owned the stock in large exchange traded funds that track the performance of S&P 500.[100] The South Korean National Pension Service owned 100,000 shares in SVB's holding company, SVB Financial Group.[101] CalPERS (California state pension fund) held about $67 million in bonds to the bank, or less than two percent of one percent of total investments, as of June 2022.[27]

On March 13, shares of similar regional banks, including First Republic Bank, Western Alliance Bancorporation, and PacWest Bancorp plummeted.[102][103]

On March 13, an SVB shareholder filed a Securities Class Action against the company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging fraud for false statements made by executives and the bank.[104]

Financial system
Market capitalization of U.S. banks lost a combined $100 billion in two days and European banks lost $50 billion.[5] SVB's losses highlighted the challenge that banks could face as interest rate increases reduced the market value of bonds that they purchased under low-rate policies.[105] Some companies have sought safety with larger commercial banks, transferring their deposits out from regional banks similar to Silicon Valley Bank, raising concerns about further instability in the banking sector.[80] Several banks, such as First Republic Bank and Western Alliance Bancorporation, issued press releases seeking to calm investors.[106][107]

Despite these concerns, banking experts believe that other banks will remain stable as SVB was overly specialized in providing banking to a risky sector of the economy, and financial regulations have strengthened since the 2008 financial crisis, which preceded the Great Recession.[13][108] SVB had, in 2021, reached the threshold under the Dodd-Frank Act requiring it to submit a resolution plan ("living will") to the FDIC, which it did the following year. It had not participated in periodic stress testing under the act, as the threshold for that requirement had been raised in 2018 under the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act; SVB's chief executive was among those requesting the change.[109][110]

On March 12, 2023, Signature Bank was also closed, being taken into possession by the New York State Department of Financial Services.[111][112] Following the bank failures, the Federal Reserve announced the creation of a Bank Term Funding Program to shore up liquidity for other at-risk banks.[113][114] Financial experts believe this program, combined with a recent practice of finding buyers who would cover all deposits, may have effectively removed the FDIC's deposit insurance limit.[61]

Investors and economists believe that a previously expected Federal Reserve interest rate increase on March 22 has become less likely as a result of the SVB collapse and other recent bank failures.[115]

Reactions
U.S. President Joe Biden discussed the collapse with California Governor Gavin Newsom on March 11.[116] In televised remarks from the White House before markets opened on March 13, Biden expressed confidence in the resilience of the banking system, pledged that the government would ensure the availability of deposits without rewarding investors with taxpayer funds, and promised to hold bank executives accountable and propose rule changes to prevent future failures.[117] Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to take steps to help Israeli technology companies get through the liquidity crisis.[118] Indian IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar met with companies to assess the impact to India's startup community.[119] UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak,[120] Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno, and South Korea's Financial Services Commission each downplayed any systemic risk to their countries' financial sectors.[119]

Venture capitalists Garry Tan and David O. Sacks, hedge fund manager Bill Ackman,[80] and California State Senator Scott Wiener called for a government intervention to protect uninsured depositors.[121] Representatives Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Eric Swalwell of California called for depositors to be made whole,[80] while Representatives Ro Khanna[116] and Brad Sherman of California called on the Treasury Department and FDIC to affirm that depositors would be protected so they could make payroll.[80] Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida and Republican presidential candidates Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy expressed opposition to any taxpayer-funded bailout of the bank. Ramaswamy suggested that the FDIC's deposit insurance limit be raised instead.[80][122]

Newsom and Representative Anna Eshoo of California applauded the FDIC's announcement that it would protect depositors without impacting taxpayers via the Bank Term Funding Program.[123][124] Mayor Matt Mahan of San Jose criticized the federal government's response to the bank's failure as slow and indicative of its misunderstanding of Silicon Valley startups' impact to the national economy.[125][123] Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts[2] and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee criticized regulators for protecting large depositors, including some of the venture capital firms that triggered the bank run.[70] Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for the repeal of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act that weakened stress testing requirements.[2][126][127] Khanna, Warren, and Mahan called for earnings from CEO Greg Becker's recent sale of SVB shares to be clawed back and returned to depositors.[123][2]

Ahmad Thomas, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, of which the bank was a member, described the failure as a setback for the San Francisco Bay Area's startup ecosystem and noted that it would be difficult to replicate the bank's business model.[128]

Cryptocurrency proponents cited the collapse in support of a decentralized monetary system. Others in the tech sector proposed that recent events in the cryptocurrency business, such as the bankruptcy of FTX and the exit of cryptocurrency-focused banks, had conditioned depositors to panic and noted that the FDIC's limited guarantee had no parallel in cryptocurrency.[28]

Several Republicans and conservative commentators argued—without evidence—the bank failed because it was "woke" and distracted by workforce diversity efforts,[129][130] particularly blaming a manager at the UK subsidiary for the risks that arose in the U.S.[131] Republican lawmakers and financial policy experts criticized the emergency actions as a bailout that could create a moral hazard at other banks.[132]
